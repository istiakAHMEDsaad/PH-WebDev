    ```
    git add .
    ```

3. For commit
    ```
    git commit -m "first commit"
    ```

4. Branch
    * git branch --> check current branch
    * git branch -M [branch name] --> rename current branch
    
    ```
    git branch -M main
    ```

5. Add remote repository
    ```
    git remote add origin [repo_link.git]
    ```

6. Check repository current active link
    ```
    git remote -v
    ```

7. Push code to github ('U' is for upstream it's define send all working code on current active branch)
    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    or
    ```
    git push origin [branch name]
    ```

8. Create new branch
    ```
    git branch [branch name]
    ```

9. Switch branch
    ```
    git checkout [branch name]
    ```

10. Delete branch
    ```
    git branch -d [branch name]
    ```

11. Create a new branch & switch that branch
    ```
    git checkout -b [branch name]-branch
    ```

NB: after create a new branch you have to set upstream (git push origin [branch name])

12. All about forking
    * first fork your desire repository, then clone it & start your project
